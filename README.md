# Churn_Prediction_ML-Approach : AutoAI

## Objective : 

Churn prediction from kaggle data set Telco Customer Churn using AutoAI

## Challenge :

- Building ML Model to predict Churn
- Making Prediction
- Converting the model to Python

## What is Churn and Why we need to Predict it :

Customer churn or customer attrition is the phenomenon where customers of a business no longer purchase or interact with the business.
Customer churn happens when customers decide to not continue purchasing products/services from an organization and end their association. 
It is an integral parameter for the organization since acquiring a new customer could cost almost 7 times more than retaining an existing customer. Customer churn can prove to be a roadblock for an exponentially growing organization and a retention strategy should be decided in order to avoid an increase in customer churn rates.  

- Churn can be predicted using Binary Classification.

## Steps in Development:
- Get Data
- Load into Watson Studio

- train the Model using AutoAI

- Generate notebook

### AutoAI:

Automate python ML pipelines and effectively gives those pipelines to deploy as RestAPI
